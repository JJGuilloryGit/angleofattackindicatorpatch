# Angle of Attack Indicator Patch

This repository is a starting point for documenting and distributing the Angle of Attack (AoA) indicator patch. It will collect notes, configuration snippets, and supporting assets needed to build, test, and ship the patch.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/JJGuilloryGit/angleofattackindicatorpatch.git`
- Add any patch files, configs, or documentation under meaningful subfolders.
- Keep changes small and well documented in commit messages so others can follow the patch history.

## Contributing
- Open issues or PRs describing the change and the AoA simulator/hardware version it targets.
- Avoid committing large binaries or generated artifacts; link to releases or attach them elsewhere if needed.
- Update this README when adding new features or setup steps so newcomers can reproduce your workflow.

## Project Status
Initial scaffolding only. Flesh out patch details, build instructions, and validation steps as they become available.
